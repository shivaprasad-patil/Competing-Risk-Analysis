# Competing-Risk-Analysis

Competing risk analysis is used to correctly estimate marginal probability of an event in the presence of competing events.

Analysing the impact of the competing risk by using the cumulative incidence function and comparing the risk groups using Grayâ€™s test.



Use the following status;
LR -- Local recurrence
OS -- Overall survival

status = 0 LR=0 & OS=0
status = 1 LR=1
status = 2 LR=0 & OS=1
